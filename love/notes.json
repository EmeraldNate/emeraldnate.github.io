    "September-18": "I love you so much! I hope your first day in Japan has been going well! I can't wait to hear all about it my love! Nothing extensive today since you have a physical letter for your arrival at your apartment. I miss you so much! ʚ♡ɞ",
    "September-19": "Hello my love! I'm so sorry yesterday was so rough. You made it! You managed to say goodbye, got through both airports, managed through the trains and arrived at your apartment! This will only get easier! I saw the text about not being able to say hi to people and that's okay! Not everyone will be friendly right away! I'm sure you'll make some acquaintances on your flat soon! And i'm sure you'll make friends in classes too, that's where my besties have came from! We're all thinking of you, even my dad keeps asking me how you're doing! Have a wonderful day my love. 𐙚⋆°｡⋆♡",
    "September-20": "Have a wonderful day today! I hope you have a lot of fun at character street today and I hope you find some super cute mofusand items! Can't wait to hear about your fantastic day, along with what you see and what you purchase. I love you ♡",
    "September-21": "Good morning/midday/evening! I miss you and love you very much! I wish I could see you and give you so many hugs. Have a great day today and have lots of fun! Tell me all about what you do and how your day goes and never forget you are loved immensely 💕.",
    "September-22": "I'm glad you had such a great day yesterday! It made me so happy to hear you are proud of yourself and what you are accomplishing! I will always be open to hearing about your day! Have a great day today and good luck registering your address! I love you 💕.",
    "September-23": "Haii ⸜(｡˃ ᵕ ˂ )⸝♡ !! Sorry the site broke yesterday (╥﹏╥) but it's all good now and i know what i did wrong lolol. I'm proud of you for making it through city hall and making a friend in the progress! I'm glad you're having so much fun in Japan!!! You are an incredibly special person, brightening the lives of those around you with your radiant smile and bubbly personality, and without a doubt you will lighten the lives of everyone you meet while you're in Japan. You are a gorgeous, wonderful person with a beautiful heart that I've only ever dreamed of having the chance to be with. You are what I dream of, my silly mischievous girlfriend. I love you, have a great day today. ",
    "September-24": "Good morning/midday/evening my love! I miss you so much today it's not even funny... I had a dream about Mochi last night, maybe for the first time ever? I was just taking care of her and cuddling with her in a room full of cats, and i'd lose her but she'd always come back to me; it was so sweet. I hope you have a great day! I love and miss you dearly! (..◜ᴗ◝..)"
