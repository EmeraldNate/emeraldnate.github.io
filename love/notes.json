    "September-19": "Hello my love! I'm so sorry yesterday was so rough. You made it! You managed to say goodbye, got through both airports, managed through the trains and arrived at your apartment! This will only get easier! I saw the text about not being able to say hi to people and that's okay! Not everyone will be friendly right away! I'm sure you'll make some acquaintances on your flat soon! And i'm sure you'll make friends in classes too, that's where my besties have came from! We're all thinking of you, even my dad keeps asking me how you're doing! Have a wonderful day my love. 𐙚⋆°｡⋆♡",

I'm proud of you for making it through city hall and making a friend in the progress! I'm glad you're having so much fun in Japan!!! You are an incredibly special person, brightening the lives of those around you with your radiant smile and bubbly personality, and without a doubt you will lighten the lives of everyone you meet while you're in Japan. You are a gorgeous, wonderful person with a beautiful heart that I've only ever dreamed of having the chance to be with. You are what I dream of, my silly mischievous girlfriend. I love you, have a great day today. ",
    "September-24": "Good morning/midday/evening my love! I miss you so much today it's not even funny... I had a dream about Mochi last night, maybe for the first time ever? I was just taking care of her and cuddling with her in a room full of cats, and i'd lose her but she'd always come back to me; it was so sweet. I hope you have a great day! I love and miss you dearly! (..◜ᴗ◝..)",

    "September-27": "Long Note Incoming-- Hello my love! I hope you're having a great day while you're reading this! This note might be a little weird but it's something that's been on my mind so I think I should share. ANYWAY I've been taking better care of myself lately, cleaning and getting enough sleep, and I feel like I definitely 1000% should've been treating you so much better!! (｡ᵕ ◞ _◟). There is SO much stuff that comes to mind but I know you'd tell me to not worry about it cause it was in the past, but I want you to know I will do so much better and treat you SO much better once you get back! I love and appreciate EVERY part of you and I promise I'll always do my best to make you happy! You are so special and you are so loved by me and I promise I'll prove it more than ever. I already have stuff planned (muahaha) for a while after your return, I'm excited to make you happy then and for the rest of our lives. ANYWAY x2 I'm glad you had such a fantastic day yesterday! I'm happy to hear you've been adjusting well and doing fun things!! The aquarium sounded SUPER fun and I'm also super glad you got all your classes registered! I love you and miss you lots and hope today is a great day! (˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶) ‹𝟹",
    "September-28": "Good morning/afternoon/evening my love! I saw when you last updated the Cozy Couples and you were up LATE XD. But you tried to write some SMUT?? OMG I am so curious you NEED to share when you get a few pages done. I've read a couple short ones from Inkitt, the app you showed me, so I'm definitely qualified to read yours... I think. BUT I CAN IMAGINE EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL WRITING THE SCENE OMGGG it's going to be so hard at first but once you do it once it will get so much easier. Also your BANGS? I LOVE the medium and heavy pinned up bangs! You could TOTALLY be a bangs girlie, i think you could 100% pull them off hehehe... I'm also very sorry something went wrong with your classes! I hope everything gets sorted out and you at least get most of your classes (or the ones you're most passionate about!) all registered! BEE TEE DUBZ sorry for yapping at ya in a bit hard Japanese, I wanted to challenge you a bit so you're ready for class! I'm sure you'll have many opportunities to use your skils there but if you'd ever like me to TRY to tutor you at all or just talk to you in Japanese I would SOOO love to!!!!! ANYWAY I love you so so much and miss you lots! I hope you have a wonderful fantastic super duper awesome day today my love! ⋆ ˚｡⋆୨♡୧⋆ ˚｡⋆"
