I know I have no idea what the coursework and difficulty is like but I know you're an insanely hard worker and I'm sure you'll be able to pass that class. You already put so much effort into your classes while having time for me and others through UCCS so far, I'm sure you'll be able to do the same at Waseda. And I'm sure you'll get at least ONE of the classes you wanted through the lottery system too. I love you lots and I hope you have a great day! Tell me all about how class goes today!જ⁀➴ ♡"

This will only get easier! I saw the text about not being able to say hi to people and that's okay! Not everyone will be friendly right away! I'm sure you'll make some acquaintances on your flat soon! And i'm sure you'll make friends in classes too, that's where my besties have came from!

This note might be a little weird but it's something that's been on my mind so I think I should share. ANYWAY I've been taking better care of myself lately, cleaning and getting enough sleep, and I feel like I definitely 1000% should've been treating you so much better!! (｡ᵕ ◞ _◟). There is SO much stuff that comes to mind but I know you'd tell me to not worry about it cause it was in the past, but I want you to know I will do so much better and treat you SO much better once you get back! I love and appreciate EVERY part of you and I promise I'll always do my best to make you happy! You are so special and you are so loved by me and I promise I'll prove it more than ever.

    "September-28": "Good morning/afternoon/evening my love! I saw when you last updated the Cozy Couples and you were up LATE XD. But you tried to write some SMUT?? OMG I am so curious you NEED to share when you get a few pages done. I've read a couple short ones from Inkitt, the app you showed me, so I'm definitely qualified to read yours... I think. BUT I CAN IMAGINE EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL WRITING THE SCENE OMGGG it's going to be so hard at first but once you do it once it will get so much easier. Also your BANGS? I LOVE the medium and heavy pinned up bangs! You could TOTALLY be a bangs girlie, i think you could 100% pull them off hehehe... I'm also very sorry something went wrong with your classes! I hope everything gets sorted out and you at least get most of your classes (or the ones you're most passionate about!) all registered! BEE TEE DUBZ sorry for yapping at ya in a bit hard Japanese, I wanted to challenge you a bit so you're ready for class! I'm sure you'll have many opportunities to use your skils there but if you'd ever like me to TRY to tutor you at all or just talk to you in Japanese I would SOOO love to!!!!! ANYWAY I love you so so much and miss you lots! I hope you have a wonderful fantastic super duper awesome day today my love! ⋆ ˚｡⋆୨♡୧⋆ ˚｡⋆",

I know how strong you are, you'll figure everything out with classes and deal with any annoyances or stresses that come your way as classes begin. And I'll be here by your side through everything.
