No doubt you'll get everything checked out and finalized and make it to the airport on time and successfully. Again I'm so proud of you for being so resilient with every hardship you've been thrown. You have been so strong and so patient, it's finally time for you to have the break you couldn't have it there. I love you and I miss you. I'm so sorry everything didn't work out but I'm excited to see you. p.s. i'm sick :DDDD"

    "September-19": "Hello my love! I'm so sorry yesterday was so rough. You made it! You managed to say goodbye, got through both airports, managed through the trains and arrived at your apartment! This will only get easier! I saw the text about not being able to say hi to people and that's okay! Not everyone will be friendly right away! I'm sure you'll make some acquaintances on your flat soon! And i'm sure you'll make friends in classes too, that's where my besties have came from! We're all thinking of you, even my dad keeps asking me how you're doing! Have a wonderful day my love. 𐙚⋆°｡⋆♡",

You are an incredibly special person, brightening the lives of those around you with your radiant smile and bubbly personality, and without a doubt you will lighten the lives of everyone you meet while you're in Japan. You are a gorgeous, wonderful person with a beautiful heart that I've only ever dreamed of having the chance to be with. You are what I dream of, my silly mischievous girlfriend. I love you, have a great day today. ",
    "September-24": "Good morning/midday/evening my love! I miss you so much today it's not even funny... I had a dream about Mochi last night, maybe for the first time ever? I was just taking care of her and cuddling with her in a room full of cats, and i'd lose her but she'd always come back to me; it was so sweet. I hope you have a great day! I love and miss you dearly! (..◜ᴗ◝..)",
    "September-25": "Hello my love! I hope you're enjoying your day so far! Mochi was super happy to see me, i'll definitely keep her company as often as I can ⸜(｡˃ ᵕ ˂ )⸝♡.

    "September-27": "Long Note Incoming-- Hello my love! I hope you're having a great day while you're reading this! This note might be a little weird but it's something that's been on my mind so I think I should share. ANYWAY I've been taking better care of myself lately, cleaning and getting enough sleep, and I feel like I definitely 1000% should've been treating you so much better!! (｡ᵕ ◞ _◟). There is SO much stuff that comes to mind but I know you'd tell me to not worry about it cause it was in the past, but I want you to know I will do so much better and treat you SO much better once you get back! I love and appreciate EVERY part of you and I promise I'll always do my best to make you happy! You are so special and you are so loved by me and I promise I'll prove it more than ever. I already have stuff planned (muahaha) for a while after your return, I'm excited to make you happy then and for the rest of our lives. ANYWAY x2 I'm glad you had such a fantastic day yesterday! I'm happy to hear you've been adjusting well and doing fun things!! The aquarium sounded SUPER fun and I'm also super glad you got all your classes registered! I love you and miss you lots and hope today is a great day! (˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶) ‹𝟹",
    "September-28": "Good morning/afternoon/evening my love! I saw when you last updated the Cozy Couples and you were up LATE XD. But you tried to write some SMUT?? OMG I am so curious you NEED to share when you get a few pages done. I've read a couple short ones from Inkitt, the app you showed me, so I'm definitely qualified to read yours... I think. BUT I CAN IMAGINE EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL WRITING THE SCENE OMGGG it's going to be so hard at first but once you do it once it will get so much easier. Also your BANGS? I LOVE the medium and heavy pinned up bangs! You could TOTALLY be a bangs girlie, i think you could 100% pull them off hehehe... I'm also very sorry something went wrong with your classes! I hope everything gets sorted out and you at least get most of your classes (or the ones you're most passionate about!) all registered! BEE TEE DUBZ sorry for yapping at ya in a bit hard Japanese, I wanted to challenge you a bit so you're ready for class! I'm sure you'll have many opportunities to use your skils there but if you'd ever like me to TRY to tutor you at all or just talk to you in Japanese I would SOOO love to!!!!! ANYWAY I love you so so much and miss you lots! I hope you have a wonderful fantastic super duper awesome day today my love! ⋆ ˚｡⋆୨♡୧⋆ ˚｡⋆",
    "September-29": "I hope you have a fantastic day today! Only two more days until classeses begin and your schedule is filled with schoolwork and activities with friends! I'm very excited for you! I was thinking of the time we went on demonbuster a whiile ago lol that was a fun night. ANYWAYY I love you so much and I hope you have a great day today, regardless of whether you're home or out! ⋆𐙚₊˚⊹♡",
    "September-30": "I love you so so so much my love. I'm sorry yesterday was very hard and stressful. Rough days and hard times only lead us to grow and to get stronger! I know how strong you are, you'll figure everything out with classes and deal with any annoyances or stresses that come your way as classes begin. And I'll be here by your side through everything. You can always come to me for any stress or anxiety that may arise, along with any exciting times that come up. I love you dearly and am so excited for you! I miss you lots my love, have a wonderful day today. 💕",
    "October-1": "Happy October my love! I hope you had lots and lots of fun last night! I know you were stressed about the dress you bought but the dress is CUTE!! I wanna see the dress on u muahahaha. If you wrote at all last night I hope it went well! Hopefully you enjoyed your writing and had a fun and relaxing time. Also I'm SORRY i missed your messages, I passed out FAST after I hopped in bed thinking you'd be out for a while. I love you! Have a fantastic day my beautiful and kind and perfect and mature wifey!! ㅤꨄ︎",
    "October-2": "HAVE A GREAT DAY AT CLASS TODAYYY!!!!! You're going to do FANTASTIC!! I know I have no idea what the coursework and difficulty is like but I know you're an insanely hard worker and I'm sure you'll be able to pass that class. You already put so much effort into your classes while having time for me and others through UCCS so far, I'm sure you'll be able to do the same at Waseda. And I'm sure you'll get at least ONE of the classes you wanted through the lottery system too. I love you lots and I hope you have a great day! Tell me all about how class goes today!જ⁀➴ ♡",
    "October-3": "I hope you're feeling well my love! I know you're very stressed about everything right now, but please eat enough and take care of yourself. I know you'll feel out your classes over the next day and decide on what you're going to do. You still have a very solid chance at getting into Comprehensive Japanese 0, so don't give up hope! I'm hopeful that the rest of your classes will go well! I love you and I miss you lots. ‎♡‧₊˚",
    "October-4": "https://youtu.be/YtB6OD3sFzg - I couldn't upload it to the server directly because it's too bigggg i had to upload it to Youtube. Also I cut it down to 10 mins that's why it kinda ends abruptly, I just kept yapping D:",
    "October-5": "I love you so much!! I hope you do some fun things today or I hope class goes well if you're attending! Please take care of yourself today! Eat some nice food and drink some pretty-looking drinks! I will always be here if you'd like to talk. I love you and miss you, have a fun and enjoyable day for me today. -`♡´-",
    "October-6": "Hello my love! I can imagine how you're feeling right now. I know you want to stay and try your best, and you don't want to let anyone down, but from what I (and your parents) have been hearing, coming home is probably the right thing to do. With more and more of your classes in Japanese the chance that things would work out is unfortunately decreasing, unless UCCS makes an exception, but right now it seems your mental health is hurt pretty bad to the point where it'll take a bit to recover, even taking fewer classes in Japan. And given that your parents are concerned with your health and want you to come home, I think it's for the best. I support you no matter what but hearing you've been constantly crying and getting more joy thinking of home makes me think it might be a good decision to return home. And I understand how you feel coming home. Not just disappointed in yourself or that you have to leave, but I know you feel like you're a delinquent and you've let everyone down. However you haven't let anyone down. You weren't told how the program was going to be. You weren't guided to register for extra classes. You weren't told almost everything was entirely in Japanese. You didn't know SO much about coming here before you were here. No one disappointed in you. You have nothing to be ashamed of. You gave it your best shot, even going to ChatGPT and asking for ideas. I am beyond proud of you for what you've accomplished so far, and for how hard you've tried. I love you and I care about you very much. I'm excited to hear how your day was yesterday! Also, you'll get to go back one day and shop for weeks or months on end. 😉",
    "October-7": "Haii Serenity! I love you! Please don't be hard on yourself! I am so proud of you and always will be! I know you're having doubts but have faith in yourself! Have faith you made the right choice! I know you were feeling very down and I believe you made the right choice as well. I'll be here, so talk to me if you're feeling anxious or just need to talk. I love and miss you. Sending hugs and love to you today! 𐙚⋆°｡⋆♡",
    "October-8": "AAAHHHHHH I WANNA HEAR ABOUT YOUR DAY YESTERDAYYYYYYY i want to hear ALL about it, i'll probably be at work when you're awake but maybe after?? If we can make it work with your schedule too of course!! Seeing the cool things the doing and how you seem to be enjoying your time makes me very very happy :D. I can't wait to talk to you, I'll be thinking of you lots today! Short note cause ik you're busyyy fr but I LOVE YOU and I MISS YOU so much!!!! Have a great day today!     p.s. thanks for chosing me to talk to over truck guy 😭",
    "October-9": "I love you very much! Please stay tuned for today's note, it will be late. https://youtu.be/jEbKnQ6bf98?si=kmLPmBPa8sL_QtV8"
