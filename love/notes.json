This will only get easier! I saw the text about not being able to say hi to people and that's okay! Not everyone will be friendly right away! I'm sure you'll make some acquaintances on your flat soon! And i'm sure you'll make friends in classes too, that's where my besties have came from! We're all thinking of you, even my dad keeps asking me how you're doing! Have a wonderful day my love. 𐙚⋆°｡⋆♡",
